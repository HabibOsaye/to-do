# to-do

This is a practice project done with JavaScript, CSS (Sass) and [Parcel](https://parcel.org). This was a shot at better understanding JS DOM manipulation, importing and use of npm packages ([date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns) and [uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid)) and also making use of a web application bundler to transcompile code.
